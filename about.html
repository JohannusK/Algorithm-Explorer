    <h1>About Algorithm Explorer</h1>
    <p>
      Algorithm Explorer is an interactive learning tool designed to help students and enthusiasts visualize and understand fundamental algorithms. The platform demonstrates how algorithms operate step by step — highlighting key concepts such as comparisons, swaps, recursion, and asymptotic growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project was developed by Jóhannus Kristmundsson and Jákup Svøðstein at the Faculty of Science and Technology, University of the Faroe Islands, as part of ongoing efforts to create engaging, open educational resources for computer science teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to make abstract algorithmic ideas more intuitive through visual explanation, animation, and interactivity — allowing users to experiment with data and see how different algorithms behave under varying conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future extensions will include graph algorithms, recursion visualizations, and complexity analysis tools to support broader topics in data structures and algorithm design. The complete source code and documentation are openly available on GitHub:
